# Next.js Link Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `Link` component in Next.js. The problem involves the `href` property not resolving correctly, leading to broken or unexpected link behavior.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem Description:

The application uses `next/link` to create internal links. However, these links fail to navigate to their intended pages.  This might manifest as a 404 error or simply no navigation occurring.

## Solution:

The solution involves double checking the `href` property's value for typos, ensuring that the route exists and is configured correctly in `pages/` directory, and verifying that any dynamic routes are correctly defined. In more complex cases, examining the Next.js routing configuration or middleware might be necessary.
